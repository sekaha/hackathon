In the year 3243, the mighty Zebra Empire thrives amidst the chaos of climate change. Evolving beyond mere survival, the Zebras developed superior intelligence and recognized the threat posed by humanity.

In 2453, they launched the infamous Zebra-Human War of '53, swiftly eradicating the human race and seizing their vast wealth. With newfound resources, the Zebras ventured into space, discovering the riches of the cosmos and expanding their empire beyond Earth.

As trade routes flourished, the void of space buzzed with Zebra travelers, and the Empire's influence spread far and wide.

That brings us to now. You are a worker of the Zebra-Exotic-Mining-Enterprise (ZEME), tasked with mining precious Zebrium, essential for warp drives and plasma cannons. While navigating the treacherous Alpha-Zebra sector, your ship has drifted into a perilous asteroid field.

With your warp computer unable to chart a safe course, your only option is to escape the field. Use your skills as a commander to navigate the chaos and destroy the menacing platonic solids that block your path.

Good luck, Commander, and godspeed!
